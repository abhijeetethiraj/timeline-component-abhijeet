 Architecture
The component is built using a composable architecture.
The main TimelineView component acts as a controller, managing state and context (like DndContext).

It composes smaller, memoized child components â€” TimelineRow, TaskBar, and TimelineHeader â€” to ensure high performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Utility functions for date, position, and dependency calculations are separated for testability and reusability.
